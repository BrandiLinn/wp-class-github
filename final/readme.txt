Category-based icons next to post titles.

== Description ==

Define icons to be associated with various categories, to be placed next to the titles of single posts within those categories. Icon sits to the left of the title and is set to be about twice the height of the title text at most. Consistent size and shape is up to the user to ensure.

= To Use =

The user may upload images through the admin panel, then copy the image link to the icon box for each category. Upload to the Media Library (or to the image hosting service of choice), copy the complete file URL, and paste it into "Icon URL" when creating or editing a category.

Only one icon will display, even if the post is under multiple categories.
